  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p><strong>Our Story</strong><br>
     B2H (Burn to Help | Born for Humanity) was created to explore a new way for technology to serve humanity. Unlike speculative digital assets, B2H was designed from the start to connect participation with real-world humanitarian impact.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Our Purpose</strong><br>
     - Embed compassion into blockchain technology<br>
     - Support verified humanitarian initiatives and aid for the poor<br>
     - Maintain transparency, accountability, and long-term trust
  </p>
  <p><strong>How We Work</strong><br>
     - <strong>Fixed Supply Token:</strong> 500 billion B2H tokens, no future minting<br>
     - <strong>Burn-to-Help Mechanism:</strong> Every defined burn event contributes to charitable allocations and reduces circulating supply<br>
     - <strong>Separate Funds:</strong> Charity, operational, and treasury funds are managed transparently<br>
     - <strong>Founder Stewardship:</strong> Project guided ethically, not for personal gain
  </p>
  <p><strong>Our Values</strong><br>
     Integrity over speed<br>
     Trust over hype<br>
     Patience over pressure<br>
     Humanity over profit
  </p>
  <p><strong>Who We Serve</strong><br>
     Individuals who want to participate consciously<br>
     Charities, NGOs, and institutions seeking transparency<br>
     Communities in need who benefit from direct, responsible support
  </p>
  <p><strong>Our Commitment</strong><br>
     B2H is a humanitarian-first project. There are no guaranteed returns, no financial promises, and no shortcuts. Participation is voluntary, and the focus is long-term impact, not short-term speculation.
  </p>
  <p><em>Our goal is to build a project that is respected globally, trusted by humans and institutions, and moral by design — a legacy that can continue beyond the founder.</em></p>
