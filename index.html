        The founder’s promise is simple:
        <strong>no one should suffer, and no power should corrupt compassion.</strong>
        Every action becomes <strong>Sadaqah Jariyah</strong>,
        creating education, healthcare, food security, and dignity.

      <div class="founder-text">
        <p class="highlight-quote">
          “Your participation, no matter how small, can ripple across the world—lifting lives, restoring dignity, and leaving a legacy that outlives us all.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
         My name is Mubashir Munnawar, and I founded Breath2Help (B2H) with a simple but powerful belief: helping humanity should be effortless, ethical, and everlasting.
        </p>

        <p>
          At B2H, every form of participation, whether through tokens, donations, or simple engagement, is designed to be secure, transparent, and immediately impactful. Your contribution is never sold, misused, or diverted. It quietly and continuously turns into real help for real people, across the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          At 57 years of age, life teaches you clarity. Wealth, titles, and recognition remain behind, but good deeds travel forward. Breath 2 Help was born from a deeply personal intention: that until my very last breath, my life will serve the poor, the needy, and the forgotten.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a system where even the smallest action creates permanent humanitarian impact, education for children, healthcare for the vulnerable, food for the hungry, and dignity for those pushed to the margins. You don’t need to manage anything or struggle with complexity. Your participation automatically becomes part of a global network of silent heroes, working together for good.
        </p>

        <p>
          B2H transforms generosity into a living system of compassion, where your giving keeps giving, again and again. This project is not driven by profit alone; it is guided by purpose. Holding the B2H token is not just ownership, it is a symbol of humanity, responsibility, and shared hope.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our model is built on trust, continuity, and accountability. Every token, every donation, and every action flows through a structured and verifiable system, giving you peace of mind and pride in knowing that your kindness is working tirelessly, even when you are not watching.
        </p>

        <p>
          I invite you to walk this journey with me, by supporting the mission, spreading kindness, and becoming part of something that truly matters. Because in the end, the greatest return we ever earn is the lives we touch.
        </p>
