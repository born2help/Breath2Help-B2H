      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        B2H (Burn to Help | Born for Humanity) was created to explore a new way
        for technology to serve humanity. Unlike speculative digital assets,
        B2H was designed from the start to connect participation with real-world
        humanitarian impact.
      </p>

        <li><strong>Fixed Supply Token:</strong> 500 billion B2H tokens, no future minting</li>

      <h3>Our Values</h3>
      <p>
        Integrity over speed<br>

    <div class="content-card">
      <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
      <p>
        Individuals who want to participate consciously, charities and NGOs

        responsible, direct support.

    <div class="content-card highlight">
      <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
      <p>
        B2H is a humanitarian-first project. There are no guaranteed returns,
        no financial promises, and no shortcuts. Participation is voluntary,
        and the focus is long-term impact — not speculation.
      </p>
      <p><em>
        Our goal is to build a project that is respected globally, trusted by
        humans and institutions, and moral by design.
      </em></p>
