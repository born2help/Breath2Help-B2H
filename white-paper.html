    <h1>White Paper — B2H Global Foundation</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Built for Humanity, Driven by Purpose, Guided by Ethics
    </p>

    <!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        B2H (Burn to Help | Born for Humanity) is a humanitarian-first blockchain initiative
        designed to translate digital participation into tangible, lasting impact.
        Unlike speculative tokens, B2H focuses on creating real-world humanitarian value
        while ensuring transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= VISION & MISSION ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Vision:</strong> A world where helping others is built into systems, creating
        lasting relief and opportunities for all, irrespective of wealth or geography.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mission:</strong> To transform contributions into sustainable, income-generating
        assets that continuously serve humanity, creating a true Sadaqah Jariyah for participants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= TOKENOMICS ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <p>
        The B2H token is designed for ethical participation and maximum humanitarian impact:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 500 billion B2H tokens, fixed supply, no future minting.</li>
        <li><strong>Burn-to-Help Mechanism:</strong> Defined token burns reduce supply while funding aid.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Allocation:</strong> Charity (5%), Operations (3%), Permanent Burn (2%), Community Supply (90%).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every token holder participates in a system where their engagement directly supports verified humanitarian initiatives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= ETHICAL FRAMEWORK ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>Ethical Framework</h2>
      <p>
        B2H is built on principles that prioritize humanity over profit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparency in all operations and reporting</li>
        <li>No personal gain for founders or trustees</li>
        <li>Faith-aligned financial practices (no interest, no Riba)</li>
        <li>Continuous oversight by a rotating ethical council</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= LONG-TERM IMPACT ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>Long-Term Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Contributions to B2H are transformed into permanent assets that generate continuous
        support for the poor and vulnerable. By structuring our model ethically and sustainably,
        every action—from token burns to project execution—delivers measurable, traceable humanitarian impact.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= PARTICIPATION ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2>How to Participate</h2>
      <p>
        Participation in B2H is voluntary, transparent, and open to all. There are no guarantees
        of financial return. Instead, contributors gain the satisfaction of knowing their
        engagement creates a living system of good—an impact that persists across generations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= CLOSING ================= -->
    <div class="wp-section highlight">
      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        B2H is more than a token; it is a humanitarian instrument. We are committed to
        long-term stewardship, transparency, and ethical management. Every participant,
        donor, and community beneficiary shares in a vision where technology serves humanity
        with integrity and compassion.
