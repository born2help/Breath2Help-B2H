        <h2 class="section-title">Burn to Help — What It Means</h2>
        <p>In B2H, burning is not destruction. It is a conscious act of responsibility. Every burn exists to protect dignity, reduce suffering, and sustain the mission.</p>
        <p>Unlike other projects that burn for hype or scarcity, B2H burns represent intentional reduction of value to create real-world impact, stability, and relief.</p>
        <p>If a burn does not serve humanity, strengthen the mission, or protect participants, it does not belong in B2H.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-section highlight">
        <h2 class="section-title green-glow">How Burns Serve Humanity</h2>
        <p>A portion of what is sacrificed is directed toward humanitarian purpose, operational sustainability, and continued service. Helping people is not treated as a marketing strategy — it is an obligation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Protection for Participants</h2>
        <p>B2H designs burns with balance: never reckless, never emotional, never driven by short-term pressure. The goal is sustainability so helping others does not sacrifice trust.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-section highlight">
        <h2 class="section-title green-glow">Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h2>
        <p>Every burn is carried out with accountability, transparency, and respect for human dignity.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Ethics in B2H</h2>
        <p>All actions are guided by responsibility, transparency, and fairness. Every participant, decision, and movement aligns with humanitarian and faith-based principles.</p>
        <p>B2H rejects exploitation, interest (Riba), and any personal enrichment. Every contribution serves humanity only.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Founder Safeguards</h2>
        <p>The Founder holds no ownership or financial privilege. Authority exists only to safeguard values, prevent misuse, and activate protections when ethical deviations occur.</p>
        <p>Transparency rules, financial locks, audit pathways, and mission-freeze mechanisms ensure that no single individual can override purpose or accountability.</p>
