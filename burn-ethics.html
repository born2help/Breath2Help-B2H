    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Burn to Help — What It Means</h2>
      <p>
        In Breath2Help, burning is not destruction.
        It is a conscious, measured act designed to protect dignity,
        reduce suffering, and preserve the mission for the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike projects that burn for hype or artificial scarcity,
        B2H burns exist only when they serve real-world humanitarian impact.
        If an action does not benefit people or protect the mission,
        it has no place within Breath2Help.
      </p>
      <p>
        This principle ensures restraint, patience, and ethical clarity —
        even when external pressure suggests otherwise.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wp-section highlight">
      <h2 class="section-title green-glow">How Burns Serve Humanity</h2>
      <p>
        What is reduced digitally is redirected ethically.
        A defined portion of burn-linked activity supports humanitarian relief,
        operational continuity, and long-term service infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helping people is never a marketing strategy —
        it is a responsibility carried with humility and care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Protection for Participants</h2>
      <p>
        Burns within B2H are never impulsive, emotional, or reactionary.
        They are designed to protect participants from volatility,
        misinformation, and short-term decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainability is not only about systems —
        it is about protecting trust, confidence, and peace of mind.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wp-section highlight">
      <h2 class="section-title green-glow">Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h2>
      <p>
        Every action is guided by intention before outcome.
        Full accountability, transparency, and respect for human dignity
        remain non-negotiable principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This alignment ensures compatibility with humanitarian
        and faith-based values, including long-term Sadaqah Jariyah.
      </p>

    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Ethics in Breath2Help</h2>
      <p>
        All activities within B2H are governed by fairness,
        responsibility, and ethical restraint.
        Exploitation, interest (Riba), deception,
        and personal enrichment are strictly rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributions exist solely to serve humanity —
        not individuals, not markets, not narratives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wp-section highlight">
      <h2 class="section-title green-glow">Core Ethical Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparency in intent, structure, and action</li>
        <li>Accountability for every decision</li>
        <li>Protection of dignity over profit</li>
        <li>Voluntary participation with informed understanding</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <!-- ================= FOUNDER SAFEGUARDS ================= -->
  <section class="section">

    <div class="wp-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Founder Safeguards</h2>
      <p>
        The Founder holds no ownership, profit rights,
        or financial privilege within Breath2Help.
        Authority exists only to protect values,
        prevent misuse, and activate safeguards when required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structural locks, transparency rules,
        ethical oversight, and mission-freeze mechanisms
        ensure that no individual can override purpose or accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission is protected not by power —
        but by structure, restraint, and collective responsibility.
      </p>
